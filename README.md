React Native docs: [https://reactnative.dev/](https://reactnative.dev/ "ReactNative Docs")



This is an open source project for educational purposes.

To run this React Native app:
1. Clone the repo from GitHub
2. Install nodejs
3. Install ExpoGo on your phone or use an emulator like Android Studio or XCode for Apple
4. Open project in a terminal so you are at the same folder level as the package.json file
5. Type 'npm install' - this installs all the dependencies
6. Once that is finished, type 'npm start'

Once the server is started, you should be able to scan the QR code with a mobile device and see the 'Hello KC' page.

If you have issues connecting with your mobile device, try connecting both your computer and mobile device to the same hotspot.

Out-of-the-box this development environment uses port 8081 on the local network, many enterprise networks will have this blocked so it's best to check it at home or with a hotspot.


If you have any issues getting it to work, you can review the setup documentation at reactnative.dev
